<title>Using the Coq macOS installer</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>How to use this installer</h1>
<p>The installation is quite easy: just drag the <b>Coq-Platform@@VERSION@@.app</b> application on the link to the <b>Applications</b> folder.</p>
<p><b>ATTENTION:</b>
   When starting CoqIDE for the first time, you must right click on it and select "open". 
   You will see a dialog box stating that the software cannot be verified to be free of malicious software. This is because the installer is signed, but not notarized.
   In this dialog box click on open and CoqIDE will start. This needs to be done only once.</p>
<p>The file <b>coq-shell@@VERSION@@.command</b> opens a terminal with environment variables set up to use the installed version of Coq. Just drag it to your desktop.
   The shell opened by this file will always use this specific version of Coq, so the file has a version specific name.
   In case you install several versions of Coq, you can keep several of these terminal links - one for each version of Coq.
   In case the specific version of Coq is no longer installed, the terminal will show an error.</p>
<p>To uninstall Coq, open the <b>Applications</b> folder and delete <b>Coq-Platform@@VERSION@@.app</b>. Also delete any copies of <b>coq-shell@@VERSION@@.command</b> e.g. from your desktop.</p>
